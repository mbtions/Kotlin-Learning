fun main(args : Array<String>) { ... }

This is the main function, which is mandatory in every Kotlin application. 
The Kotlin compiler starts executing the code from the main function.

The function takes array of strings as a parameter and returns Unit. 
You will learn about functions and parameters in later chapters.

For now, just remember that main function is a mandatory function which is the entry point of every Kotlin program. 
The signature of main function is:
fun main(args : Array<String>) {
    ... .. ...
}
println("Hello, World!")

The println() function prints the given message inside the quotation marks and newline to the standard output stream. 
In this program, it prints Hello, World! and new line.
